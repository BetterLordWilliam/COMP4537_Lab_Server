<p>Netflix's early architecture was a single, monolithic application. While simple to start, this design made it difficult to scale and update as the company grew. Every change required modifying the entire system, a process that became slow and complicated. To solve this, Netflix began transitioning to an AWS (Amazon Web Services) powered <strong>microservices architecture</strong> in 2008. This move allowed them to achieve the massive scalability, reliability, and speed they needed to become the streaming giant we know today.</p>

<p>This section attempts to explain some of the microservices and microservice related technologies that Netflix employs.</p>
<iframe src="./Amazon Microservices.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<ul>
<li><strong>EC2</strong> → “Elastic Computer Cloud” amazon scalable compute power. Accommodate variable user demand by scaling up the capacity (RAM cap, CPU processing power, storage) of virtual instances.</li>
<li><strong>S3</strong> → Amazon unstructured data storage (storing raw video for example).</li>
<li><strong>RDS</strong> → Amazon relational databases for structured data storage .</li>
<li><strong>Netflix Zuul</strong> → Netflix API gateway, receives incoming requests and routes them to the correct service.</li>
<li><strong>Netflix Eureka</strong> → Allows other services to discover each other without having to “know” the service beforehand.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication/Authorization API</strong> → Handles user authorization and authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Search API</strong> → Queries Netflix content/data stores and returns results.</li>
<li><strong>Discovery/Recommendation API</strong> → Powers the recommendations and discovery feature (algorithms powered by ML) to serve users content that they may also want to watch.</li>
<li><strong>Async Messaging API</strong> → Facilitates asynchronous communication between services.</li>
<li><strong>Open Connect CDN →</strong> Custom CDN Netflix built to optimize the delivery of video. Servers around the world to optimize the delivery of content to a global user base.</li>
</ul>
<p>Netflix services are responsible for their own domain of data and therefore have their own databases. This is known as the <strong>database-per-service</strong> pattern. This ensures that Netflix microservices can function independently. Netflix enforces data consistency by syncing data between services over time.</p>
<p>Netflix uses 700 microservices btw…</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Scalability</strong> → System compute can be scaled in accordance with variable demand from users.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Increased complexity</strong> → Managing the communication between services is a challenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Modularity</strong> → System can be modified at a granular level, as long as system API remains consistent.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Deployment and Version Coordination</strong> → Coordinating the deployments and versions between services introduces additional considerations with respect to compatibility issues between services.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Fault Isolation</strong> → System faults are isolated to specific services, which makes the process of identifying and correcting the source of the fault less daunting</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Testing complexity</strong> → Specifically, integration testing. Orchestrating tests across multiple services is challenging and complex.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Quicker Deployments</strong> → The entire system does not need to be redeployed if only 1 system needs to be updated or is receiving changes.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Data management</strong> → Data consistency across services can be complicated and can lead to discrepancies between data if not handled correctly.</td>
</tr>
