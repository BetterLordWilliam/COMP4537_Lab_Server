1. open the writer.html and reader.html in two different tabs of same browser. Would the reader.html have access to the content stored in the local storage by the writer.html?

    Yes, the two windows of the website in the same browser reflect the changes in local storage. This is because local storage object is defined per the website root.
    Since the lab pages are from the same root website (and given they are open in the same browser program), they share local storage.

2. open the writer.html and reader.html in two different tabs of two different browsers ( e.g. one in chrome, one in Firefox) . Would the reader.html have access to the content stored in the local storage by the writer.html?

    No, local storage objects are persisted by the specific browser (firefox, chrome) so changes on the same root website will not be reflected across different browsers.
